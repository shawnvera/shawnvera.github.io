                    What are you thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of 
                    rendering content and providing user experience?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I feel that HTML and CSS are both familiar with a lot of people, but JavaScript is what 
                    really throws a curve ball at people. I&apos;ve worked in all three languanges during the intro 
                    to web development class, and Javascript still has me a little confused. I can see that the 
                    three very different roles each language plays in a website may help to keep orthogonality 
                    in tact.

                    What are you thoughts on pseudocoding?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Pseudocoding is difficult for me as I like to just jump in an &quot;get my hands dirty&quot; so to 
                    speak. After this past week I can definitely see the value in pseudocode. It makes for a 
                    great starting point on a project, and helps to clear the logic out before coding.

                    What was helpful during onboarding that made working remotely easier?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The coaches availability helped a lot with this bootcamp being remote. They were always 
                    available to help whenver it was needed, which is much appreciated.

                    What hindered your progress during onboarding?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    IF anything hindered my progress it may have been my need to figure things out on my own. 
                    I&apos;m going to be working in the coming weeks on asking for help more frequently as I don&apos;t 
                    want to spend too much time with a blocker.

                    How did you overcome challenges during onboarding?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    By asking questions and using the resources provided to find answers. I also used Google 
                    and Youtube quite often.
